# NBASimulator

README

You can run the program using the driver. Type 1 for the single game simulator and 2 for the season simulator. With both you can either auto generate a roster or select a roster manually (by inputting y or n). The code is meant to simulate/project NBA player stats and team performances.

There are separate functions fields for determining single game stats and whole season stats, and those starts are basically added up to determine team performance.
